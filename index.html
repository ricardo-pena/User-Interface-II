        <div id ="about-p">
            <p>I am a full stack web develeper student at Lambda School. Born and rasied in Sandy Springs,Georgia, I first started my IT journey in middle school creating simple games on a program called Scratch.
                There I discovered my passion for solving problems using code. Later on I moved from creating games to expirementing with robotics. I created a lego robot that was one of two in my class to be eligible to compete with other schools.
                This taught me the relationship between code and hardware. In Highschool I took the computer science pathway where one of the courses involved creating websites. I really loved creating websites but due to the course being fairly short,
                we did not go too in depth of how to add functionality. In college, I learned software programing with Java. With the skills I gained, I took on an internship at Equifax and created a web app to streamline 
                maintenance and incident notification request. Here I was reminded of how much I loved creating websites bringing me to Lambda School to become a full stack web developer.
